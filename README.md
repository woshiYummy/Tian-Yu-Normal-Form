# Tian-Yu-Normal-Form
A program to compute the normal form of some ordinary functions. 

The algorithm of this program comes from the paper:
Tian Y., Yu P. An explicit recursive formula for computing the normal forms associated with semisimple cases[J].
  Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 2014, 19(7): 2294-2308.

My program is less efficient than the authorsâ€™.
